# CustomLinkedList
In case of storing data in form of Array the limitation is that it has fixed size, hence we have ArrayList to overcome this problem. But the internal implementation of arraylist is not so much optimized and also it is hard to utilize its full functionalities because, in arraylist it creates new array double size everytime when the  array is filled upto specific amount of size. Then it copies all previous items to new one which is not so cool and always there is some portion of array which stays unutilised.
This problem is resolved by the LinkedList.
The internal implementation of LinkedList contains enums. This repo is about custom LinkedList specifically for integer type, all methods assosiated with linked list are programmed.
